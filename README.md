# 🌦️ Weather Forecast App

A modern and responsive weather app that displays real-time weather data using the **OpenWeather API**.  
Built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Recharts**, it visualises temperature, humidity, and wind trends in a clean dark interface.


## ✨ Features


- 🌡️ Real-time temperature, humidity, and wind data  
- 📈 Interactive charts with Recharts  
- 🌙 Dark and responsive design  
- ⚡ Fast and server-rendered with Next.js  


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is deployed on **Vercel** for fast global delivery and automatic CI/CD. Visit the website at **[Weather App](https://weather-app-flame-two-18.vercel.app/)** 🌤️

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

Building this weather app taught me how to integrate third-party APIs efficiently and handle dynamic data rendering in real time.  
I learned how to:
- Use **OpenWeather API** to fetch and structure live weather data 🌦️  
- Visualise data using **Recharts** with custom domains and smooth transitions 📊  
- Manage environment variables safely with **Vercel** deployments 🔐  
- Optimise UI responsiveness and state management in **Next.js** ⚡  

### 💪 Challenges
- **API response timing:** Solved by adding loading states and async error handling.  
- **Chart scaling issues:** Adjusted Y-axis domains for better data visibility.  
- **Environment setup on Vercel:** Fixed by prefixing public variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.  

Each fix helped me understand the balance between clean design and reliable backend integration 💫
